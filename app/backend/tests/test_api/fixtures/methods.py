def is_table_sorted(columns_info: List[Tuple[List[Any], bool]]) -> bool:
    """
    Checks whether a table is sorted according to multi-column sort orders.

    The parameter is a list of tuples (column, descending) where:
      - 'column' is an ordered sequence representing the values in that column.
      - 'descending' is a boolean: when True, the column must be in descending order;
        when False, the column must be in ascending order.

    The tableâ€™s rows are constructed by taking the ith element from each column. To decide
    whether row i and row i+1 are in correct order, we compare them column by column:
      - If the values are equal, the decision falls to the next column.
      - If they differ, the decision is based on the sort order defined in that column:
          * Ascending (False): value_i should be <= value_i+1
          * Descending (True): value_i should be >= value_i+1
